## Notes

My main challenge was in getting all the elements to display the correct things at the same time and at the right times. I took half of the time working on this project just figuring that out. At the end I did have a bug when calculating the score, but was able to get that working by realizing I was calling a function twice causing it to go past the calculation of one of the questions.
